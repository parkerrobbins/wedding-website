It is accessible. 

When driving into the park, please tell the ranger that you are here for our wedding. You do not need to show your invitation. They will direct you to the correct location. 

Our ceremony will be outside, weather permitting. There will be bench seating. There is not much shade, so sun protection is advised. In case of rain, the ceremony will take place in the Cabin.

## The Plan 

Our ceremony will begin at 12 so **please arrive around 11:45am.** Hors d'Ouvres will begin around 12:30pm and there will be a cocktail hour while we get pictures taken. There are gardens to walk through and sit in, and dancing will take place in the Cabin. Lunch will be served buffet-style no later than 2pm. There will be an open bar for the first hour of the reception; after that, it will be a cash bar. 

There is a block of rooms at a nearby hotel. If you require accommodation, please indicate for which night(s) you would like to stay when you RSVP. 

The attire is [dressy casual](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-dressy-casual). 

## The Registry

As we are moving to Canada, we will not be able to take a lot of things with us, therefore our registry is sparse. We would also appreciate money for our moving, furniture, and eventual honeymoon fund. Though we appreciate the sentiment, please be aware that we will not be able to use gift cards purchased in the U.S. in Canada.

## Frequently asked questions

**Aren't you two already married?**

Yes, Elisabeth and Parker were married at City Hall in Worcester, Massachusetts, on 18 March 2021. (We will consider this day our wedding anniversary.) After having our wedding delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic last year, we did not want to delay getting married for another year, so we decided to have a small ceremony and celebration with family. Now that it's becoming safer to gather, we wanted to have a ceremony and reception more like the one we originally intended, surrounded by our friends and family.

**Did Elisabeth change her name?**

No, Elisabeth is keeping her last name.

**Why did you move the wedding so many times?** 

We originally planned to get married on 3 October 2020. Of course, the pandemic had other plans for us. We then pushed the wedding to 18 September 2021, hoping that the pandemic would be under control by then. That date would have marked the eighth anniversary of our relationship. But then we found out that Parker had been accepted to a Master of Arts program in Linguistics at the University of Toronto, which starts in early September. 

**When are you moving to Toronto?** 

We are hoping to move the second week of August, shortly after the wedding. Wish us luck!
